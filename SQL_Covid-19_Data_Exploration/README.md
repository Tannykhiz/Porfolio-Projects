# Covid-19: A Global Data Exploration (2020 -2024)
## Description 
This project delves into a comprehensive COVID-19 data set spanning January 1st 2020 to February 2024, acquired 
from the [World Health Organisation (WHO)](https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/cases?n=c)
## Objectives 
- Mortality Rate Assessment: Uncover the likelihood of succumbing to COVID-19 upon infection, providing crucial information for risk assessment and public health initiatives.
- Global Hotspots: Identify the countries that have borne the brunt of COVID-19 infections, allowing for targeted resource allocation and support.
- Death Toll Analysis: Pinpoint the nations with the highest death counts, enabling a deeper understanding of the pandemic's severity and guiding future preparedness efforts.
- Beyond the Numbers: Explore potential correlations between factors like demographics, healthcare infrastructure, and socioeconomic conditions with the course of the pandemic in various countries. 


## Reflection 
This project reaffirmed the importance of exploratory data analysis in understanding complex phenomena like COVID-19. Digging into the WHO dataset allowed me to uncover patterns and trends that wouldn't have been readily apparent from raw numbers. It was a humbling experience to witness the power of data visualization in communicating the pandemic's global impact. The project has fueled my passion for using data analysis to make a positive impact on the world.
