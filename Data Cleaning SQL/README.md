# Nashville Housing Data: A Clean Slate for Analysis (using SQL)

## Project Overview 
This project delves into the Nashville housing dataset obtained from Kaggle found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmthyjames/nashville-housing-data),
aiming to transform raw data into a well-organized and user-friendly format suitable for further analysis.

## Objectives 
- Address Breakdown: The initial "PropertyAddress" column held a wealth of information, but it wasn't readily accessible. This project broke it down into separate columns for "Address," "City," and "State," allowing for more granular analysis of location data.
  
- Standardizing Dates: Dates can be tricky when they're not formatted uniformly. This project ensured a consistent date format across the dataset, making it easier to perform date-related calculations and visualizations.

- Populating Missing Property Addresses: Not all entries had complete address information. This project addressed missing property address data, ensuring a more comprehensive dataset.
- Duplicate Detection and Removal: Redundant data can skew insights. This project identified and removed duplicate entries, leading to a cleaner and more reliable dataset.
- Column Cleanup: Not all columns were relevant for the analysis. Unnecessary columns were removed to streamline the data and improve focus.
Clarity over Confusion: Y/N values can be ambiguous. This project replaced them with clear and concise "Yes" and "No" labels, enhancing readability and interpretation.

## Reflection 
Data cleaning might seem like a tedious task, but it's a crucial foundation for any data analysis project. By dedicating time to cleaning this dataset, I've created a solid base for exploring Nashville's housing market. The transformed data is now ready for further exploration, visualization, and the generation of valuable insights.
This project not only cleaned the data but also provided an opportunity to explore SQL functionalities like data manipulation and transformation. By working with real-world data, I've gained practical experience in data wrangling, a skill set valuable for any data analysis project.
