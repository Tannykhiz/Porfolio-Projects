## My Portfolio Website 
I developed this porfolio website using HTML/CSS and Javascript to exhibit my data analysis skills and projects. I deployed the site on 
[here](https://www.google.com) to enrich my understanding of back-end dev. I did learn alot from making this website, the greatest reward was bringing 
my own creation to life and publishing it for others to engage with.
